# Project Euler - Problem 91 - Right Triangles with Integer Coordinates
The points P <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(x_1, y_1)"> and Q <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(x_2, y_2)"> are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(0, 0)">, to form ΔOPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 2">.

Given that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 50">, how many right triangles can be formed?
